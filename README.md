A simple project I did to learn about real-time communication between server and browser using SocketIO.
I created this prject to further my knowledge on networking and front and back end devlopment.
Functionality:
  Network Discovery: Scans local network (192.168.0.0/24) using ARP protocol
  Real-time Monitoring: Continuously scans every second for device changes
  Web Interface: Flask app serves live device list at localhost:5001
  Device Info: Shows IP address, MAC address, and manufacturer for each device
